IDEA OF GAME
You have to reach the shining cube which is at diagnol extreme from the 
starting position without falling in the pits,if you fall inthem the game
ends.you can climb up the moving cubes.

Controlers
	1.Arrow keys for motion.
	2.Space for jump;
	3.r for running;
	4.c to change camera view.
	5.w,a,s,d to change  the selected tile in tile view.
	5.mouse click and motion for helicopter view.
	6.'1' and '2' keys for zooming in helicopter view.

I am thankful to opensource community for opengl development to
provide the source code for glm.cpp which helps to include .obj files in 
the source.
